Whereas, for a guest user, if Add to cart popup modal is enabled then the cart will be abandoned once the email address is entered in popup modal.

This will send the same coupon code to all customers to whom that abandon cart email is sent to.

                            If you want to send a unique coupon code to each customer, then you need to enable the <strong>"Generate unique coupon codes"</strong> setting.

The merge tags in the email template are replaced with the data of the store, like admin email address, two simple products of the store and other information are fetched and replaced with the merge tags. When the actual abandon cart recovery emails are sent out, these merge tags will be replaced with the customer’s cart data.'

						It is also possible that you are using the Add to Cart button on a custom page & not one of the default pages like WooCommerce’s shop page, product page, category page and on the home page.
