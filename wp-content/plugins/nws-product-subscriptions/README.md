# WooCommerce Subscribe All The Things

WooCommerce Subscribe All The Things was an experimental mini-extension for [WooCommerce Subscriptions](http://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/) that explored the possibility of adding subscription plans to non-subscription product types, such as Simple and Variable products.

The project was developed and maintained as a collaboration between the teams at [Prospress](https://prospress.com/) and [SomewhereWarm](https://somewherewarm.gr/).

The plugin is now officially available on WooCommerce.com as [All Products For WooCommerce Subscriptions](http://woocommerce.com/products/all-products-for-woocommerce-subscriptions/). Read the full story [here](https://github.com/somewherewarm/woocommerce-subscribe-all-the-things/issues/436).
